# Chromium Control Canvas

A GitHub Copilot canvas that drives a real **headful Chromium** window via Playwright.
The host app's built-in `browser` canvas is WebKit (WKWebView); this gives you actual
Chromium, controllable both from the panel UI and by the agent.

The canvas panel is a control strip (URL bar, back/forward/reload, screenshot). A separate
Chromium window does the real rendering, because you can't embed Chromium inside a WebKit
iframe.

## Files

- `extension.mjs` — the extension: canvas declaration, Playwright launch, a loopback HTTP
  server for the panel, and the agent actions.
- `index.html` — the control strip UI the panel renders.
- `package.json` — declares the `playwright` dependency and `"type": "module"`.
- `copilot-extension.json` — name/version metadata.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18 or newer** (Playwright 1.60 requires `node >=18`; older versions hit a
  cryptic engine error). The extension runs as a Node child process.
- The app's **canvas / UI-extensions experiment enabled**. Without it, the extension
  loads but the canvas never appears in the panel. Enable it in the app's
  Settings → Experiments. (This may not be available to all accounts.)

## Install

Drop this folder at `~/.copilot/extensions/chromium-control-canvas/` (user scope) or in a repo's
`.github/extensions/chromium-control-canvas/` (project scope), then install dependencies and the
Chromium binary from inside that folder:

```sh
cd ~/.copilot/extensions/chromium-control-canvas
npm install                     # playwright is declared in package.json
npx playwright install chromium # downloads the browser, a few hundred MB
```

Reload extensions in the app, then open the `chromium-control-canvas` canvas.

Note: copying the extension files only places the source. It does **not** run the
commands above or enable the experiment, so those steps are still required on first
setup.

## Attach to your own Chrome

By default the canvas launches the bundled Chromium with a persistent profile. To drive
a Chrome you already have running instead, start it with a debug port and pass `cdpUrl`
when opening the canvas:

```sh
google-chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222   # then open the canvas with cdpUrl: http://localhost:9222
```

In this mode the extension connects over CDP and never launches or kills your browser;
closing the canvas just disconnects.

## Agent actions

- `navigate { url }` — go to a URL or search query (blocklist-guarded).
- `back` / `forward` / `reload` — history navigation.
- `current_url` — current URL and page title.
- `snapshot` — structured list of visible interactive elements, each with a stable ref.
- `click { ref | selector }` — click an element by snapshot ref or CSS selector.
- `type { ref | selector, text, submit? }` — fill an input; optionally press Enter.
- `screenshot { fullPage? }` — save a PNG to `artifacts/` and return its path and size.

## Notes

- A persistent profile is stored in `profile/` so logins survive restarts. **Do not commit
  or share `profile/`** — it contains real session cookies.
- Raw `evaluate` (arbitrary in-page JS) is intentionally omitted.
- `navigate` is checked against a blocklist, and a request interceptor also blocks
  navigations to blocked hosts that happen via in-page redirects. The shipped
  `BLOCKLIST` entries are illustrative examples, not real coverage — edit the list in
  `extension.mjs` to fit your environment.
- The loopback control server requires a per-launch token (templated into the panel),
  so other pages in your browser can't drive it.
- Typed text (e.g. passwords) is redacted in `audit.log`, and password field values are
  excluded from snapshots.
- Generated at runtime and not part of the source: `node_modules/`, `profile/`,
  `artifacts/`, `audit.log`.
