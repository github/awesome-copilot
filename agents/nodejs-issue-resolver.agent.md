# Node.js Agentic Issue Resolver

This sample demonstrates a robust developer agent built with the GitHub Copilot SDK. 

### Key Features
- **Resilient Strategy**: Specifically uses `write_file` for full-content updates to avoid string-matching errors.
- **Observability**: Streams real-time reasoning and tool execution logs.
- **Autonomous**: Explores project structures and applies fixes based on natural language tasks.
