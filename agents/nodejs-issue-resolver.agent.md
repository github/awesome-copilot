# Node.js Agentic Issue Resolver

This sample demonstrates a robust implementation of an autonomous developer agent. 

### Key Features
- **Resilient Strategy**: Specifically designed to overcome string-matching failures in the Technical Preview by using `write_file` for full-content updates.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Streams assistant deltas and tool execution events for high observability.
- **Autonomous Workflow**: Capable of exploring directory structures and applying fixes based on task descriptions.
