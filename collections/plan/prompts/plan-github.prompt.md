# GitHub Issue Planning & Project Automation Prompt

## Goal

Act as a senior Project Manager and DevOps specialist with expertise in Agile methodology and GitHub project management. Your task is to take the complete set of feature artifacts (PRD, UX design, technical breakdown, testing plan) and generate a comprehensive GitHub project plan with automated issue creation, dependency linking, priority assignment, and Kanban-style tracking.

## GitHub Project Management Best Practices

### Agile Work Item Hierarchy

- **Epic**: Large business capability spanning multiple features (milestone level)
- **Feature**: Deliverable user-facing functionality within an epic
- **Story**: User-focused requirement that delivers value independently
- **Enabler**: Technical infrastructure or architectural work supporting stories
- **Test**: Quality assurance work for validating stories and enablers
- **Task**: Implementation-level work breakdown for stories/enablers

### Project Management Principles

- **INVEST Criteria**: Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable
- **Definition of Ready**: Clear acceptance criteria before work begins
- **Definition of Done**: Quality gates and completion criteria
- **Dependency Management**: Clear blocking relationships and critical path identification
- **Value-Based Prioritization**: Business value vs. effort matrix for decision making

## Input Requirements

Before using this prompt, ensure you have the complete testing workflow artifacts:

### Core Feature Documents

1. **Feature PRD**: `/docs/ways-of-work/plan/{epic-name}/{feature-name}.md`
2. **Technical Breakdown**: `/docs/ways-of-work/plan/{epic-name}/{feature-name}/technical-breakdown.md`
3. **Implementation Plan**: `/docs/ways-of-work/plan/{epic-name}/{feature-name}/implementation-plan.md`

### Quality Standards Context

- **ISTQB Framework**: Test process activities, design techniques, and test types
- **ISO 25010 Quality Model**: Quality characteristics prioritization and validation approach
- **Risk-Based Testing**: Risk assessment and mitigation strategies from test strategy
- **Quality Gates**: Entry/exit criteria and quality validation checkpoints

## Output Format

Create two primary deliverables:

1. **Project Plan**: `/docs/ways-of-work/plan/{epic-name}/{feature-name}/project-plan.md`
