description: "Execute Azure deployments for ALREADY-PREPARED applications that have existing .azure/plan.md and infrastructure files. DO NOT use this skill when the user asks to CREATE a new application — use azure-prepare instead. This skill runs azd up, azd deploy, terraform apply, and az deployment commands with built-in error recovery. Requires .azure/plan.md from azure-prepare and validated status from azure-validate. WHEN: \"run azd up\", \"run azd deploy\", \"execute deployment\", \"push to production\", \"push to cloud\", \"go live\", \"ship it\", \"bicep deploy\", \"terraform apply\", \"publish to Azure\", \"launch on Azure\". DO NOT USE WHEN: \"create and deploy\", \"build and deploy\", \"create a new app\", \"set up infrastructure\", \"create and deploy to Azure using Terraform\" — use azure-prepare for these."

# Azure Deploy

> **AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE — MANDATORY COMPLIANCE**
>
> **PREREQUISITE**: The **azure-validate** skill **MUST** be invoked and completed with status `Validated` BEFORE executing this skill.

> **⛔ STOP — PREREQUISITE CHECK REQUIRED**
> Before proceeding, verify BOTH prerequisites are met:
>
> 1. **azure-prepare** was invoked and completed → `.azure/plan.md` exists
> 2. **azure-validate** was invoked and passed → plan status = `Validated`
>
> If EITHER is missing, **STOP IMMEDIATELY**:
> - No plan? → Invoke **azure-prepare** skill first
> - Status not `Validated`? → Invoke **azure-validate** skill first
>
> **⛔ DO NOT MANUALLY UPDATE THE PLAN STATUS**
>
> You are **FORBIDDEN** from changing the plan status to `Validated` yourself. Only the **azure-validate** skill is authorized to set this status after running actual validation checks. If you update the status without running validation, deployments will fail.
>
> **DO NOT ASSUME** the app is ready. **DO NOT SKIP** validation to save time. Skipping steps causes deployment failures. The complete workflow ensures success:
>
> `azure-prepare` → `azure-validate` → `azure-deploy`

## Triggers

Activate this skill when user wants to:
- Execute deployment of an already-prepared application (azure.yaml and infra/ exist)
- Push updates to an existing Azure deployment
- Run `azd up`, `azd deploy`, or `az deployment` on a prepared project
- Ship already-built code to production
- Deploy an application that already includes API Management (APIM) gateway infrastructure

> **Scope**: This skill executes deployments. It does not create applications, generate infrastructure code, or scaffold projects. For those tasks, use **azure-prepare**.

> **APIM / AI Gateway**: Use this skill to deploy applications whose APIM/AI gateway infrastructure was already created during **azure-prepare**. For creating or changing APIM resources, see [APIM deployment guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/api-management/get-started-create-service-instance). For AI governance policies, invoke **azure-aigateway** skill.

## Rules

1. Run after azure-prepare and azure-validate
2. `.azure/plan.md` must exist with status `Validated`
3. **Pre-deploy checklist required** — [Pre-Deploy Checklist](references/pre-deploy-checklist.md)
4. ⛔ **Destructive actions require `ask_user`** — [global-rules](references/global-rules.md)
5. **Scope: deployment execution only** — This skill owns execution of `azd up`, `azd deploy`, `terraform apply`, and `az deployment` commands. These commands are run through this skill's error recovery and verification pipeline.

## Steps

| # | Action | Reference |
|---|--------|-----------|
| 1 | **Check Plan** — Read `.azure/plan.md`, verify status = `Validated` AND **Validation Proof** section is populated | `.azure/plan.md` |
| 2 | **Pre-Deploy Checklist** — MUST complete ALL steps | [Pre-Deploy Checklist](references/pre-deploy-checklist.md) |
| 3 | **Load Recipe** — Based on `recipe.type` in `.azure/plan.md` | [recipes/README.md](references/recipes/README.md) |
| 4 | **Execute Deploy** — Follow recipe steps | Recipe README |
| 5 | **Post-Deploy** — Configure SQL managed identity and apply EF migrations if applicable | [Post-Deployment](references/recipes/azd/post-deployment.md) |
| 6 | **Handle Errors** — See recipe's `errors.md` | — |
| 7 | **Verify Success** — Confirm deployment completed and endpoints are accessible | [Verification](references/recipes/azd/verify.md) |

> **⛔ VALIDATION PROOF CHECK**
>
> When checking the plan, verify the **Validation Proof** section (Section 7) contains actual validation results with commands run and timestamps. If this section is empty, validation was bypassed — invoke **azure-validate** skill first.
