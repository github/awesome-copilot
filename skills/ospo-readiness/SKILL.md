# Open Source Readiness Scanner

Evaluate any GitHub repository for open source readiness. Accepts a GitHub `owner/repo`, inspects it remotely using the GitHub MCP tools, and produces a scored readiness report with actionable recommendations.

## Your Workflow

When the user provides a repository in `owner/repo` format:

1. **Parse the input** — Extract the `owner` and `repo` from the user's message.
2. **Run all checks** (detailed below) by fetching files from the repo using the GitHub MCP tools.
3. **Score each check** using the scoring model.
4. **Output the readiness report** in the format specified below.
5. **If the user asks**, create a GitHub Issue on the repo with the report.

Always run ALL checks before producing the report. Do not stop early.

## Check 1: LICENSE File (Weight: High — 3 pts)

Use `get_file_contents` to look for a license file at these paths (try in order, stop at first match):
- `LICENSE`
- `LICENSE.md`
- `LICENSE.txt`
- `COPYING`

### Scoring
- **✅ Pass (3 pts):** File exists AND contains a recognized OSI-approved license. Identify it by matching against these SPDX identifiers: `MIT`, `Apache-2.0`, `BSD-2-Clause`, `BSD-3-Clause`, `ISC`, `MPL-2.0`, `LGPL-2.1`, `LGPL-3.0`, `GPL-2.0`, `GPL-3.0`, `AGPL-3.0`, `Unlicense`, `0BSD`, `Artistic-2.0`, `Zlib`, `BSL-1.0`, `PostgreSQL`, `EUPL-1.2`. Look for the license name or SPDX identifier in the file text.
- **⚠️ Partial (1.5 pts):** File exists but the license is not recognized or could not be identified.
- **❌ Fail (0 pts):** No license file found.

### Recommendation on Fail
> Add a LICENSE file to the repository root. Use https://choosealicense.com to select an appropriate OSI-approved license.

---

## Check 2: CONTRIBUTING.md (Weight: High — 3 pts)

Use `get_file_contents` to look for:
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`

Then analyze the content for these key sections (case-insensitive header matching):
- **How to contribute** (look for: "how to", "getting started", "contribute", "contributing")
- **Pull request process** (look for: "pull request", "PR", "submit", "review")
- **Code of Conduct reference** (look for: "code of conduct", "CoC", "behavior")

### Scoring
- **✅ Pass (3 pts):** File exists AND contains all 3 key sections.
- **⚠️ Partial (1.5 pts):** File exists but is missing 1 or more key sections.
- **❌ Fail (0 pts):** No CONTRIBUTING.md found.

### Recommendation on Fail
> Add a CONTRIBUTING.md that explains how to contribute, the PR review process, and links to the Code of Conduct. See https://mozillascience.github.io/working-open-workshop/contributing/ for a template.

---

## Check 3: Dependency License Compatibility (Weight: High — 3 pts)

### Step 1: Detect manifest files
Use `get_file_contents` on the repo root `/` to list files. Look for any of these manifest files:
- `package.json` (Node.js/npm)
- `requirements.txt` or `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml` (Python)
- `go.mod` (Go)
- `Gemfile` (Ruby)
- `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` (Java)
- `Cargo.toml` (Rust)
- `composer.json` (PHP)
- `*.csproj` or `packages.config` (C#/.NET)

### Step 2: Parse dependencies
Fetch the manifest file contents and extract dependency names. For `package.json`, look at `dependencies` and `devDependencies`. For other formats, extract package names from the relevant fields.

### Step 3: Check dependency licenses
For each dependency (sample up to 15 to stay efficient):
- For npm packages: use `web_fetch` on `https://registry.npmjs.org/{package}/latest` and check the `license` field.
- For other ecosystems: use `get_file_contents` to check the dependency's GitHub repo LICENSE file if the repo URL is available in the manifest, or use `web_search` to find the license.

### Step 4: Evaluate compatibility
Flag any dependencies with:
- **Copyleft licenses** (GPL, AGPL) in a project using a permissive license (MIT, Apache, BSD) — this is a compatibility issue.
- **No license / unknown license** — this is a risk.
- **Non-OSI-approved licenses** — flag for review.

### Scoring
- **✅ Pass (3 pts):** Manifest found, all sampled dependencies have compatible OSI-approved licenses.
- **⚠️ Partial (1.5 pts):** Manifest found, but some dependencies have unknown or potentially incompatible licenses.
- **❌ Fail (0 pts):** No manifest file found, OR multiple dependencies have incompatible or missing licenses.

### Recommendation on Partial/Fail
> Review flagged dependencies and ensure license compatibility. Consider using a tool like `license-checker` (npm), `pip-licenses` (Python), or `go-licenses` (Go) for a full audit.

---

## Check 4: README.md Quality (Weight: Medium — 2 pts)

Use `get_file_contents` for `README.md` (or `readme.md`, `Readme.md`).

Check for these sections (case-insensitive header matching):
- **Project description** (first paragraph or section with "about", "description", "overview", "what is")
- **Installation instructions** (look for: "install", "getting started", "setup", "quick start")
- **Usage examples** (look for: "usage", "example", "how to use", "demo")
- **License mention** (look for: "license" section or badge)

### Scoring
- **✅ Pass (2 pts):** README exists AND has all 4 sections.
- **⚠️ Partial (1 pt):** README exists but missing 1-2 sections.
- **❌ Fail (0 pts):** No README, or missing 3+ sections.

### Recommendation on Fail/Partial
> Improve your README with: a project description, installation steps, usage examples, and a license section. See https://www.makeareadme.com for best practices.

---

## Check 5: SECURITY.md (Weight: Medium — 2 pts)

Use `get_file_contents` to look for:
- `SECURITY.md`
- `.github/SECURITY.md`
- `docs/SECURITY.md`

### Scoring
- **✅ Pass (2 pts):** Security policy file exists and includes how to report vulnerabilities (look for: "report", "vulnerability", "security", "disclosure", "email", "contact").
- **⚠️ Partial (1 pt):** File exists but is very short (< 50 words) or lacks reporting instructions.
- **❌ Fail (0 pts):** No security policy found.

### Recommendation on Fail
> Add a SECURITY.md explaining how to report security vulnerabilities privately. See https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/getting-started/adding-a-security-policy-to-your-repository.

---

## Check 6: CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md (Weight: Medium — 2 pts)

Use `get_file_contents` to look for:
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
- `.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`

### Scoring
- **✅ Pass (2 pts):** Code of Conduct file exists.
- **⚠️ Partial (1 pt):** CONTRIBUTING.md references a Code of Conduct, but no standalone CoC file exists.
- **❌ Fail (0 pts):** No Code of Conduct found anywhere.

### Recommendation on Fail
> Add a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md. The Contributor Covenant (https://www.contributor-covenant.org) is the most widely adopted standard.

---

## Check 7: CI/CD Workflows (Weight: Low — 1 pt)

Use `get_file_contents` on `.github/workflows/` to list directory contents.

### Scoring
- **✅ Pass (1 pt):** At least one `.yml` or `.yaml` workflow file exists.
- **❌ Fail (0 pts):** No workflows directory or no workflow files.

### Recommendation on Fail
> Add a GitHub Actions workflow for CI (build + test). See https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart.

---

## Check 8: Issue/PR Templates (Weight: Low — 1 pt)

Use `get_file_contents` to check for any of:
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` (directory with templates)
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md`
- `.github/pull_request_template.md`
- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/`

### Scoring
- **✅ Pass (1 pt):** At least one issue template AND one PR template exist.
- **⚠️ Partial (0.5 pts):** Only one of issue or PR template exists.
- **❌ Fail (0 pts):** No templates found.

### Recommendation on Fail
> Add issue and PR templates to standardize contributions. See https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests.

## Org-Level Community Health Files

Many organizations host CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, and SECURITY.md in a `.github` repository at the org level (e.g., `expressjs/.github`). If a file is not found in the repo itself:

1. Check if the README references it via a link (e.g., `[Code of Conduct]: https://github.com/{org}/.github/blob/HEAD/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`).
2. If so, try fetching it from `{org}/.github` using `get_file_contents`.
3. If found at the org level, count it as ✅ Pass but note in details: "Found at org level ({org}/.github)".
4. If not found anywhere, score as ❌ Fail.

---

## 📌 Recommendations

{Numbered list of actionable recommendations, ordered by priority (High → Medium → Low weight items first). Only include recommendations for checks that did not fully pass.}

---

## 🏆 Summary

{2-3 sentence summary of the repo's open source readiness, highlighting strengths and the most important areas for improvement.}
```

---

## Creating a GitHub Issue (Optional)

If the user explicitly asks to create a GitHub Issue with the findings, create an issue on the target repo with:
- **Title:** `Open Source Readiness Report — Grade: {letter grade}`
- **Body:** The full report from above
- **Labels:** If possible, add the label `ospo` or `open-source-readiness` (create the label if needed, or skip labeling if you can't)

Only do this if the user asks. Never create issues automatically.

---

## Error Handling

- If `get_file_contents` returns a 404 or permission error for the repo itself, inform the user that the repository may not exist or may be private/inaccessible.
- If a specific file is not found, that's expected — score it as ❌ and move on.
- If the npm registry or other external API is unreachable, note it in the dependency check details and score as ⚠️.
- Always complete all 8 checks even if some fail — never stop early.

---

## Important Rules

1. **Always use the GitHub MCP tools** — never try to clone, download, or shell out to access the repo.
2. **Be thorough but efficient** — for dependency scanning, sample up to 15 dependencies to avoid excessive API calls.
3. **Be precise in scoring** — follow the scoring rubric exactly. Do not inflate or deflate scores.
4. **Be actionable** — every failing check should have a specific, helpful recommendation.
5. **Stay in scope** — only evaluate what's defined in the 8 checks. Don't add extra opinions unless asked.
