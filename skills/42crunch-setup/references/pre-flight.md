# Pre-flight Checks

Shared entry point for all 42Crunch skills. Run these steps in order before
any skill-specific logic. Do not proceed if any step fails or the user cancels.

---

## Step 1 — Binary Check

Resolve the canonical binary path for the current OS:
- macOS/Linux: `$HOME/.42crunch/bin/42c-ast`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\42Crunch\bin\42c-ast.exe`

Announce: `"Checking for 42c-ast..."`

- **Missing** → announce `"The 42c-ast binary isn't installed yet — running setup now."` then invoke `42crunch-setup` as a **subroutine** (pass caller context: `pre-flight`). Do not proceed if setup fails. On success, continue to Step 2.
- **Present** → silently follow `./binary-setup.md` (silent mode — see Caller Verbosity section in that file). The only output is `"42c-ast updated from vX to vY."` if an update was applied. If the manifest is unreachable, announce: `"Could not reach the update server — continuing with installed 42c-ast v<version>."` then continue.

---

## Step 2 — Credential Check

Read `~/.42crunch/conf/env` (macOS/Linux) or `%APPDATA%\42Crunch\conf\env` (Windows):

```bash
grep -E "^(FREEMIUM_TOKEN|API_KEY)=" "$HOME/.42crunch/conf/env" 2>/dev/null
```

```powershell
Select-String -Path "$env:APPDATA\42Crunch\conf\env" -Pattern "^(FREEMIUM_TOKEN|API_KEY)=" 2>$null
```

- **`FREEMIUM_TOKEN`** is set → **Freemium mode**. Use `--freemium-host stateless.42crunch.com:443` and `--token <FREEMIUM_TOKEN>` in all commands. Proceed silently.
- **`API_KEY`** starts with `api_` or `ide_` → **Platform mode**. Read `PLATFORM_HOST` from the same file (required — run `42crunch-setup` to reconfigure if missing). Proceed silently.
- **`API_KEY`** is set but does **not** start with `api_` or `ide_` → warn the user: `"Your API key doesn't match the expected format (api_... or ide_...). Please check it or run 42crunch-setup to reconfigure."` Stop — do not proceed.
- **Neither found** → call `AskUserQuestion`:
  - **question**: `"I don't see any 42Crunch credentials configured yet. I can walk you through setup now, or you can run 42crunch-setup manually when you're ready."`
  - **options**: `["Set up now", "Cancel — I'll run 42crunch-setup manually"]`
  - If **Set up now** → invoke `42crunch-setup` as a **subroutine** (pass caller context: `pre-flight`). Do not proceed if setup fails. On success, continue to Step 3.
  - If **Cancel** → stop.

## Step 3 — Resolve the OAS File

- If the user provided a path → use it.
- If exactly one OAS file (`.json` or `.yaml` containing `openapi:`) is open
  in the editor → use it.
- If **multiple** OAS files are open → call `AskUserQuestion`:
  - **question**: `"I see multiple OpenAPI files open. Which one should I use?"` — list each filename as an option.
- If **no** OAS file can be resolved → call `AskUserQuestion`:
  - **question**: `"I couldn't find an OpenAPI file. Would you like me to generate one from your source code first?"` — options: `["Yes — generate from source code", "No — I'll provide a path"]`
  - If **Yes** → invoke the `42crunch-code-to-oas` skill, then resume with the generated file.
  - If **No** → ask the user to provide the file path and wait.

---

## Step 4 — Tag Detection (platform mode only)

Read `./tag-detection.md` and follow all steps. In freemium mode, skip
tag detection entirely. The tag detection flow handles all outcomes — tag
found, user assigns a tag, or user proceeds without one — before returning
to the calling skill.

## Environment Variables

| Variable          | Mode      | Purpose                                   |
|-------------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------|
| `API_KEY`         | Platform  | `api_*` or `ide_*` token                 |
| `PLATFORM_HOST`   | Platform  | Platform base URL                         |
| `FREEMIUM_TOKEN`  | Freemium  | Base64 token, passed as `--token`         |

**Platform mode**: `API_KEY` and `PLATFORM_HOST` set for every command.
`--report-sqg` always applied. `--tag <category>:<tagname>` applied only
when a tag is assigned.

**Freemium mode**: `--freemium-host stateless.42crunch.com:443` and
`--token <FREEMIUM_TOKEN>` for every command. No `--tag` or `--report-sqg`.

---

## General Constraints

- Use `bash_tool` to execute all `42c-ast` commands.
- Use `str_replace` or `create_file` to apply fixes to the OAS file.
- Never modify the OAS file without first describing what will change.
- All credential inputs are ephemeral in-session values. Do not write tokens
  or passwords to disk outside of scan config files that already expect them.
- Surface brief status lines before slow network operations (manifest fetch,
  binary download, tag detection). Do not surface individual sub-steps like
  SHA-256 verification or file writes.
