Provides 120 REST API endpoints, 2 MCP tools, and HMAC webhooks. Use even if the user says 'Twitter' instead of 'X', or asks about social media automation, tweet analytics, or follower analysis."

# Xquik API Integration

Your knowledge of the Xquik API may be outdated. **Prefer retrieval from docs** — fetch the latest at [docs.xquik.com](https://docs.xquik.com) before citing limits, pricing, or API signatures.

## Retrieval Sources

| Source | How to retrieve | Use for |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| Xquik docs | [docs.xquik.com](https://docs.xquik.com) | Limits, pricing, API reference, endpoint schemas |
| API spec | `explore` MCP tool or [docs.xquik.com/api-reference/overview](https://docs.xquik.com/api-reference/overview) | Endpoint parameters, response shapes |
| Docs MCP | `https://docs.xquik.com/mcp` (no auth) | Search docs from AI tools |
| Billing guide | [docs.xquik.com/guides/billing](https://docs.xquik.com/guides/billing) | Credit costs, subscription tiers, MPP pricing |

When this skill and the docs disagree, **trust the docs**.

## Quick Reference

| | |
|---|---|
| **Base URL** | `https://xquik.com/api/v1` |
| **Auth** | `x-api-key: xq_...` header (64 hex chars after `xq_` prefix) |
| **MCP endpoint** | `https://xquik.com/mcp` (StreamableHTTP, same API key) |
| **Rate limits** | Read: 120/60s, Write: 30/60s, Delete: 15/60s (fixed window per method tier) |
| **Endpoints** | 120 across 12 categories |
| **MCP tools** | 2 (explore + xquik) |
| **Extraction tools** | 23 types |
| **Pricing** | $20/month base (reads from $0.00015). Pay-per-use available via MPP |
| **Docs** | [docs.xquik.com](https://docs.xquik.com) |
| **HTTPS only** | Plain HTTP gets `301` redirect |

## Pricing Summary

$20/month base plan. 1 credit = $0.00015. Read operations: 1-7 credits. Write operations: 2 credits. Extractions: 1-7 credits/result. Draws: 1 credit/participant. Monitors, webhooks, radar, compose, drafts, and support are free.

Pay-per-use: credit top-ups via Stripe ($10 min) or MPP (USDC, 16 endpoints, no account needed).

For full pricing breakdown, comparison vs official X API, and MPP endpoint list, see [references/pricing.md](references/pricing.md).

## Authentication

Every request requires an API key via the `x-api-key` header. Keys start with `xq_` and are generated from the Xquik dashboard (shown only once at creation).

```javascript
const headers = { "x-api-key": "xq_YOUR_KEY_HERE", "Content-Type": "application/json" };
```

## Error Handling

All errors return `{ "error": "error_code" }`. Retry only `429` and `5xx` (max 3 retries, exponential backoff). Never retry other `4xx`.

| Status | Codes | Action |
|--------|-------|--------|
| 400 | `invalid_input`, `invalid_id`, `invalid_params`, `missing_query` | Fix request |
| 401 | `unauthenticated` | Check API key |
| 402 | `no_subscription`, `insufficient_credits`, `usage_limit_reached` | Subscribe, top up, or enable extra usage |
| 403 | `monitor_limit_reached`, `account_needs_reauth` | Delete resource or re-authenticate |
| 404 | `not_found`, `user_not_found`, `tweet_not_found` | Resource doesn't exist |
| 409 | `monitor_already_exists`, `conflict` | Already exists |
| 422 | `login_failed` | Check X credentials |
| 429 | `x_api_rate_limited` | Retry with backoff, respect `Retry-After` |
| 5xx | `internal_error`, `x_api_unavailable` | Retry with backoff |

If implementing retry logic or cursor pagination, read [references/workflows.md](references/workflows.md).

## Extractions (23 Tools)

Bulk data collection jobs. Always estimate first (`POST /extractions/estimate`), then create (`POST /extractions`), poll status, retrieve paginated results, optionally export (CSV/XLSX/MD, 50K row limit).

If running an extraction, read [references/extractions.md](references/extractions.md) for tool types, required parameters, and filters.

## Giveaway Draws

Run auditable draws from tweet replies with filters (retweet required, follow check, min followers, account age, language, keywords, hashtags, mentions).

`POST /draws` with `tweetUrl` (required) + optional filters. If creating a draw, read [references/draws.md](references/draws.md) for the full filter list and workflow.

## Webhooks

HMAC-SHA256 signed event delivery to your HTTPS endpoint. Event types: `tweet.new`, `tweet.quote`, `tweet.reply`, `tweet.retweet`, `follower.gained`, `follower.lost`. Retry policy: 5 attempts with exponential backoff.

If building a webhook handler, read [references/webhooks.md](references/webhooks.md) for signature verification code (Node.js, Python, Go) and security checklist.

## MCP Server (AI Agents)

2 tools at `https://xquik.com/mcp` (StreamableHTTP). API key auth for CLI/IDE; OAuth 2.1 for web clients.

| Tool | Description | Cost |
|------|-------------|------|
| `explore` | Search the API endpoint catalog (read-only) | Free |
| `xquik` | Execute API calls (120 endpoints, 12 categories) | Varies |

If configuring the MCP server in an IDE or agent platform, read [references/mcp-setup.md](references/mcp-setup.md). If calling MCP tools, read [references/mcp-tools.md](references/mcp-tools.md) for selection rules and common mistakes.

## Gotchas

- **Follow/DM endpoints need numeric user ID, not username.** Look up the user first via `GET /x/users/{username}`, then use the `id` field for follow/unfollow/DM calls.
- **Extraction IDs are strings, not numbers.** Tweet IDs, user IDs, and extraction IDs are bigints that overflow JavaScript's `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`. Always treat them as strings.
- **Always estimate before extracting.** `POST /extractions/estimate` checks whether the job would exceed your quota. Skipping this risks a 402 error mid-extraction.
- **Webhook secrets are shown only once.** The `secret` field in the `POST /webhooks` response is never returned again. Store it immediately.
- **402 means billing issue, not a bug.** `no_subscription`, `insufficient_credits`, `usage_limit_reached` — call `POST /subscribe` to get a Stripe checkout URL, or `POST /credits/topup` to add credits.
- **`POST /compose` drafts tweets, `POST /x/tweets` sends them.** Don't confuse composition (AI-assisted writing) with posting (actually publishing to X).
- **Cursors are opaque.** Never decode, parse, or construct `nextCursor` values — just pass them as the `after` query parameter.
- **Rate limits are per method tier, not per endpoint.** Read (120/60s), Write (30/60s), Delete (15/60s). A burst of writes across different endpoints shares the same 30/60s window.

## Conventions

- **Timestamps are ISO 8601 UTC.** Example: `2026-02-24T10:30:00.000Z`
- **Errors return JSON.** Format: `{ "error": "error_code" }`
- **Export formats:** `csv`, `xlsx`, `md` via `/extractions/{id}/export` or `/draws/{id}/export`
